# ETH SF Hackathon project

Hi all this is the Melo Cafe's submission for Eth SF.

### Polygon Sponsor prize submission details

_best UX category_
This website employs some UX best practices that hopefully make the Melo Cafe interface a very delightful experience!

- Cute branding & colorful design system
- Intuitive page flows
- Clear, simple language
- Follows accessibility guidelines
- Forms have user input validation and prevents users from creating faulty transactions

_best Developer Tool or DAO Tooling_
Melo Cafe enables holders of an NFT or token to anonymously vote on proposals on-chain, which enables a different style of collaboration not yet seen with DAOs.

### The Graph sponsor prize submission details

This project uses The Graph to index proposals and vaults created on Melo Cafe~

### IPFS sponsor prize submission details

This project uses web3.storage to host description texts on MeloCafe proposals.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
